# FP-GS
Existing advanced compression methods focus on designing various context models for **entropy modeling**, but lack the exploration of **prediction** techniques. 
In this paper, we dig into feature correlations in the anchor-based Gaussian representation and propose two types of feature prediction techniques to further reduce the scene redundancy.
Extensive experiments show that our method can further enhance compression performance while maintaining rendering quality compared to existing 3DGS compression methods.
